I really like using Markdown.
I think I'll use it to format all of my documents from now on.
Don't put tabs or spaces in front of your paragraphs.
Keep lines left-aligned like this.

This is the first line.  
And this is the second line.

First line with two spaces after.  
And the next line.

First line with the HTML tag after.<br>
And the next line.
